<br><h1> Programming II </h1>

<br><h3><i>Description & Personal Thoughts</i></h3>
<p>
  <b>Programming II</b> is the follow-up course of <a href="https://github.com/Haruno19/notebook/tree/main/Primo%20Anno/Primo%20Semestre/Programmazione%201"><b>Programming I</b></a>.<br>
  Its main purpose was introducing and explaining <i>Object Oriented Programming</i> and all its properties, with particular focus on <i>polymorphism</i>. 
</p>
<p>
  As for the previous programming course, we used <i>Java</i> as the reference programming language, and <i>Eclipse IDE</i> for managing projects.
</p>
<p>
  I didn't quite attend lectures for this course either, so there are just a few notes. <br>
  Notes for this course are taken with <i>Craft Docs</i> and exported in the <code>markdown</code> format.
