<br><h1> Linear Algebra and Geometry </h1>

<br><h3><i>Description & Personal Thoughts</i></h3>
<p>
  <b>Linear Algebra and Geometry</b> was, content-wise, the most difficult course of the first year for me. <br>
  It's about <i>matrix</i>, <i>vectorial space</i>, <i>linear functions</i>, <i>multi-dimensional geometry</i> and others.
</p>
<p>
  As for the <a href="https://github.com/Haruno19/notebook/tree/main/Primo%20Anno/Primo%20Semestre/Analisi%201"><b>Mathematical Analysis I</b></a> course, I enoyed this course's contents, but it was still a tough course for me.
</p>
<p>
  For this course, I took notes with my <i>iPad</i> and the <i>GoodNotes5</i> App and exported it all in <code>.pdf</code> format.
