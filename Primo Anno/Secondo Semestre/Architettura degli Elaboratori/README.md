<br><h1> Computer Architecure </h1>

<br><h3><i>Description & Personal Thoughts</i></h3>
<p>
  <b>Computer Architecure</b> was the most interesing course of the first year. <br>
  It's about various arguments, from the <i>binary and hexadecimal</i> systems, to how information is represented inside of a computer (so, <i>two's complement</i>, <i>floating point</i>, <i>ASCII and Unicode</i>...), to <i>logic gates</i> and <i>sequential logic</i> and many others.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The most interesting topics for me were: 
  <ul>
    <li>the <i>Arithmetic Logic Unit</i> [ALU]'s logic scheme and internal workings</li>
     <summary><li><i>MIPS32 Assembly</i> language <h6><i>(which made me interested in ARM Assembly as well, check out my <a href="https://github.com/Haruno19/m1-assembly">M1 Assembly</a> repository for that)</i></h6></li></summary>
    <li>the <i>Datapath</i></li>
  </ul>
</p><br>
<p>
  <b>Computer Architecure</b> was indeed the course with the most interesting contents in it, and I totally loved it.<br>
  Unfortunately, the examination methods were really poorly thought and organized, resulting in an extremely punitive exam.
</p>
<p>
  For this course, I took notes with <i>Craft Docs</i> on my <i>MacBook</i>, and exported it in the <code>markdown</code> format.
