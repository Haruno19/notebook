<br><h1> Programming I </h1>

<br><h3><i>Description & Personal Thoughts</i></h3>
<p>
  <b>Programming I</b> is a course where we learned the basis of programming using Java as the reference programming language. <br>
  I used the latest version available of <code>openjdk</code> for compiling and running code, and <i>Visual Studio Code</i> as my code editor. 
</p>
<p>
  I haven't attended almost any <b>Programming I</b> lecture, so there are no notes here; just the code for the second half of the first exam.
