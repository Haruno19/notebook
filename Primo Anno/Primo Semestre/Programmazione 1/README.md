<h1> Programming 1 </h1>

<b>Programming 1</b> is a course where we learned the basis of programming using Java as the reference programming language. <br>
I used the latest version available of `openjdk` for compiling and running code, and <i>Visual Studio Code</i> as my code editor. <br>
<br>
I haven't attended almost any <b>Programming 1</b> lecture, so there are no notes here; just the code for the second half of the first exam.
