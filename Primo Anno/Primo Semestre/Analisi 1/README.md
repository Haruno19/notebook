<br><h1> Mathematical Analysis I </h1>

<br><h3><i>Description & Personal Thoughts</i></h3>
<p>
  <b>Mathematical Analysis I</b> was the toughest course of the first semetster for me.<br>
  It is about the basis of mathematical analysis, icluding various arguments like <i>series and sequences</i>, <i>limits</i>, <i>derivatives and integrals</i>.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoyed the contents of this course, but still it was a bit challening for me.<br>
</p>
<p>
  For this course, I took notes with my <i>iPad</i> and the <i>GoodNotes5</i> App and exported it all in <code>.pdf</code> format.
